#Learning From Data <br/>Assignment 1

## Robin Schut - Sharif Hamed

In this assignment we discuss classification problems for sentiment and topic analysis on different sentences.
The classifier used in this project is from the Scikit-Learn package. The Naive Bayes learning algorithm is used. 
We perform several experiments and discuss the results. Further, we comment on prior and posterior probabilities.
